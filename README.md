# Setup/Installation

 - Use macOS (Should work on Windows since Qt is multiplatform, but haven't tested this) -- definitely works on macOS Monterey
 - Install Qt Creator. This may take a long time. I apologize. Here is the link (which hopefully works) for the Qt installer: https://www.qt.io/download-qt-installer?hsCtaTracking=99d9dd4f-5681-48d2-b096-470725510d34%7C074ddad0-fdef-4e53-8aa8-5e8a876d6ab4
 - Open Qt Creator
 - Click File in the menu bar
 - Click Open File or Project
 - Find the mm-prj1 folder (which contains the source code for this project) and select mm-prj1.pro and click Open

# Running the program

 1. Click the green play button (Run) in Qt Creator. 
 2. You should see a window open with two big buttons: WAV and PNG. Click one of them to get started. The rest should be straightforward.
